A tool for developers (and cheaters) to open locked doors without requiring the key.

This mod will add a new action called "Open Sesame" to door context menus to allow you to open them without requiring the key.

I wrote this to be agnostic of the SPT/EFT version, so you should rarely (if ever) have to update it.
