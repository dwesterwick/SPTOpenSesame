A tool for developers (and cheaters) to open locked doors without requiring the key.

This mod will add a new action called "Open Sesame" to door context menus to allow you to open them without requiring the key.

You can also enable options in the Configuration Manager to write debug messages when the context menu opens or when you select the "Open Sesame" action. Enabling these will allow you to see the door ID (when the context menu opens) and the key ID (when you unlock it via the "Open Sesame" action).

I wrote this to be agnostic of the SPT/EFT version, so you should rarely (if ever) have to update it.
